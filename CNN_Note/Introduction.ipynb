    "## Key Concepts of CNNs\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Principle of images**\n",
    "   - An image in a computer is essentially a collection of numbers arranged in an orderly manner, with values ranging from **0 to 255** (from darkest to brightest). The most common way to represent images is through the RGB color model. In this model, the colors and lights of the three primary colors—red, green, and blue—are combined in various proportions to produce a wide range of colors and lights. Each image in the RGB model is composed of three matrices, each corresponding to one of the primary colors. These matrices are organized in a structured manner and can be understood as three-dimensional tensors. **Each of these matrices is referred to as a channel of the image**, which can be described in terms of width, height, and depth.\n",
    "  \n",
    "2. **Convolution**:\n",
    "   - Convolution is one of the core operations of Convolutional Neural Network (CNN), which is a mathematical operation mainly used to process image and signal data. Convolution extracts features from the input data by applying a specific filter, also known as a convolutional kernel or filter matrix, to slide over the input data.\n",
    "   - **Convolution operation**\n",
    "       - Place the convolution kernel on an area of the input data\n",
    "       - The elements in the corresponding position are multiplied and then summed to get a single value\n",
    "       - Place this value in the corresponding position of the output matix\n",
    "       - Slide the convolution kernel and repeat until the entire input data is covered\n",
    "     \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Convolutional Layers**:\n",
    "   - **Filters/Kernels**: A convolutional kernel is a small matrix (e.g. 3x3, 5x5, etc.) that contains a set of weights. These weights are learned through training and are used to extract specific features.\n",
    "   - **Stride**: The step size with which the filter moves across the input data. A stride of 1 means the filter moves one pixel at a time, while a stride of 2 means it moves two pixels at a time.\n",
    "   - **Padding**: Adding extra pixels around the border of the input data to control the spatial size of the output. Common types include 'valid' (no padding) and 'same' (padding to keep the output size the same as the input size).\n",
    "       - We need padding to let the center of the convolution kernel align to the edges of the input image, keeping the size of the output image.\n",
    "\n",
    "     \n",
    "3. **Activation Functions**:\n",
    "   - **ReLU (Rectified Linear Unit)**: A non-linear activation function applied after each convolution operation to introduce non-linearity into the model, allowing it to learn more complex patterns.\n",
    "     \n",
    "\n",
    "3. **Pooling Layers**:\n",
    "   - **Max Pooling**: A down-sampling operation that reduces the spatial dimensions of the input by taking the maximum value within a defined window, helping to reduce the computational load and control overfitting.\n",
    "   - **Average Pooling**: Similar to max pooling, but instead of taking the maximum value, it takes the average value within the window.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "4. **Fully Connected Layers**:\n",
    "   - Neurons in these layers are fully connected to all activations in the previous layer, similar to traditional neural networks. They aggregate the features extracted by the convolutional and pooling layers to perform the final classification.\n",

    "## Architecture of a CNN\n",
    "\n",
    "A typical CNN architecture consists of a series of layers, including convolutional layers, activation functions, pooling layers, and fully connected layers. Here’s a simple example of a CNN architecture for image classification:\n",
    "\n",
    "1. **Input Layer**: Accepts raw image data (e.g., 32x32x3 for a color image with height 32, width 32, and 3 color channels).\n",
    "2. **Convolutional Layer**: Applies a set of filters to extract features from the input image.\n",
    "3. **ReLU Activation**: Introduces non-linearity.\n",
    "4. **Pooling Layer**: Reduces the spatial dimensions of the feature maps, through selecting the maximum value or average value of pooling window.\n",
    "5. **Convolutional + ReLU + Pooling Layers**: Repeated to further extract higher-level features.\n",
    "6. **Fully Connected Layer**: Aggregates features and performs the final classification.\n",
    "7. **Output Layer**: Produces the final classification result (e.g., a probability distribution over classes)."
